This example code uses the `Nexmo` library to send SMS messages with verification codes. To use it, you will need to sign up for a Nexmo account and get an API key and secret. You will also need to set up a virtual number that can send SMS messages.

In the registration route, the user's password is salted and hashed before being stored in the `users` data store.

In the login route, the user's password is compared with the hashed password in the data store. If the password matches, a verification code is generated and sent to the user's phone number via SMS using the Nexmo client. The code and the user's username are stored in memory for verification.

In the verification route, the user's entered code is compared with the stored code. If they match, the user is logged in and the verification properties are removed from the user object. If the user enters an incorrect code too many times, they are blocked from further attempts.

Note that this is just an example code, and you should modify and customize it to fit your specific requirements. You may also want to add additional security measures, such as rate limiting or IP blocking, to prevent abuse of the verification system.
